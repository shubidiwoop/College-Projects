# College-Projects
Archive of codes of college projects - MIT 2016-2020


## Overview 
This repo consists of the codes of the side-projects executed by my during my undergrad degree in MIT, Manipal from 2016-2020

## Salt and Pepper Noise Manipulation using MATLAB
The project's aim was to add and remove noise using the median filter and producing the output in real time. Worked in Digital Signal Processing Lab in MIT, Manipal

## DES Algorithm
It consists of as symmetric-key block cipher which uses a 16 round Feistel structure. The verification of the algorithm was employed on MATLAB. An IEEE paper for the same was presented at the college's VLSI Lab. Worked on VHDL in MIT, Manipal 

## Leaky Bucket Algorithm
Worked in Communication Network Lab in MIT, Manipal
