# College-Projects
Archive of codes of college projects - MIT 2016-2020 and UCD 2022-2023


## Overview 
This repo consists of the codes of the side-projects executed by me during my undergrad degree at MIT, Manipal from 2016-2020, and my postgrad degree at UCD, Dublin from 2022-2023

## Salt and Pepper Noise Manipulation using MATLAB
The project's aim was to add and remove noise using the median filter and produce the output in real-time. Worked in Digital Signal Processing Lab in MIT, Manipal

## DES Algorithm
It consists of as symmetric-key block cipher which uses a 16 round Feistel structure. The verification of the algorithm was employed on MATLAB. An IEEE paper for the same was presented at the college's VLSI Lab. Worked on VHDL at MIT, Manipal 

## Leaky Bucket Algorithm
Worked in Communication Network Lab at MIT, Manipal

## SIGI EDA
I delved into an extensive analysis of the SIGI database by OECD
